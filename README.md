# Misc


### A few C++ functions and classes that I have written, and may be useful elsewhere. 
#### (Much of this code is experimental and has found minimal use and has not been fully tested. I am happy to receive any feedback / advice / enhancements / etc.)



- some `<algorithm>` equivalents for expensive comparisons
- classes to allocate space for multiple arrays in a single allocation
- a min-max heap
- functions for argument pack manipulation
- Size aware caches
