# Misc

A few C++ functions and classes that I have used, and may be useful elsewhere. This code has not been fully tested. I am happy to receive any feedback/advice/enhancements/etc.

A few C++ functions and classes that I have used, and may be useful elsewhere.

- some `<algorithm>` equivalents for expensive comparisons
- classes to allocate space for multiple arrays in a single allocation
- a min-max heap
- functions for argument pack manipulation
